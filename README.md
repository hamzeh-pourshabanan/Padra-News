# Padra-News (Working in Progress...)
Padra News is a project which show cases the use of Paging3 using kotlins flows and coroutines.

In this branch you'll find:
*   Kotlin **[Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html)** for background operations.
*   A single-activity architecture, using the **[Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started)** to manage fragment operations.
*   Reactive UIs using **StateFlow** observables and **Data Binding**.
*   A **data layer** with a repository and two data sources (local using Room and remote) that are queried with one-shot operations (no listeners or data streams).
